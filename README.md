# Kathakali Bhava Classification Project - Deep Learning and Bhava Classification

Welcome to the Deep Learning and Bhava Classification component of the Kathakali Bhava Classification project. In this phase, we employ deep learning techniques to classify Kathakali Bhavas based on the extracted features.

## Project Overview

In this phase of the project, we perform the following tasks:

- Utilize an LSTM-based deep learning model for Bhava classification.
- Train the model using the extracted features obtained in the Landmark Detection and Feature Extraction phase.
- Evaluate the model's performance and classification accuracy.

## Getting Started

To use this code and reproduce the deep learning and classification process, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script (`bhava_classification.ipynb` or `bhava_classification.py`).
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook/script to execute the deep learning model training and classification.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (if using the notebook)
- Deep Learning Framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Extracted features dataset from Project 1

## Project Structure

- `bhava_classification.ipynb` or `bhava_classification.py`: The main script or notebook for deep learning and Bhava classification.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset of extracted features.
- `models/`: Directory for saving trained models.
- `results/`: Directory for storing model evaluation results.

## Results

We achieved a classification accuracy of [insert accuracy percentage] in identifying Kathakali Bhavas using the trained deep learning model.
